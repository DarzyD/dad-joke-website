# Random Dad Jokes!



Here is a demo of the webpage

## Overview

This is a website where you can generate random dad jokes that are fetched from an API made by [icanhazdadjokes](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api).


### `Build Instructions`
Once you download the code, open a terminal and change your directory to where you have the code installed.\
To run an instance of this webpage on your browser, make sure you have Node.js installed.\
Then, from the terminal run the command `npm start`\
This should create a browser connected to http://localhost:3000

### `Usage`
To generate a joke, click on the `New Joke` button.\
If you find the joke funny, you can copy the joke to your clipboard with the `Copy to clipboard` button

### `Motivation`
The goal of this project was to practice more with React.js, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.\
Additionally, while dad jokes can make your eyes roll, I do find some of them to be funny.
